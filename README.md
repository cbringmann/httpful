[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nategood/httpful.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/nategood/httpful) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/nategood/httpful/downloads.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/nategood/httpful)

Httpful is a simple Http Client library for PHP 8.0+.  There is an emphasis of readability, simplicity, and flexibility â€“ basically provide the features and flexibility to get the job done and make those features really easy to use.

Features

 - Readable HTTP Method Support (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH and OPTIONS)
 - Custom Headers
 - Automatic "Smart" Parsing
 - Automatic Payload Serialization
 - Basic Auth
 - Client Side Certificate Auth
 - Request "Templates"

# Sneak Peak

Here's something to whet your appetite.  Search the twitter API for tweets containing "#PHP".  Include a trivial header for the heck of it.  Notice that the library automatically interprets the response as JSON (can override this if desired) and parses it as an array of objects.

```php

// Make a request to the GitHub API with a custom
// header of "X-Trvial-Header: Just as a demo".
$url = "https://api.github.com/users/nategood";
$response = \Httpful\Request::get($url)
    ->expectsJson()
    ->withXTrivialHeader('Just as a demo')
    ->send();

echo "{$response->body->name} joined GitHub on " .
                        date('M jS', strtotime($response->body->created_at)) ."\n";
```

# Installation

## Composer

Httpful is PSR-0 compliant and can be installed using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).  Simply add `nategood/httpful` to your composer.json file.  _Composer is the sane alternative to PEAR.  It is excellent for managing dependencies in larger projects_.

    {
        "require": {
            "cbringmann/httpful": "*"
        }
    }

## Install from Source

Because Httpful is PSR-0 compliant, you can also just clone the Httpful repository and use a PSR-0 compatible autoloader to load the library, like [Symfony's](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/class_loader.html). Alternatively you can use the PSR-0 compliant autoloader included with the Httpful (simply `require("bootstrap.php")`).

## Build your Phar

If you want the build your own [Phar Archive](http://php.net/manual/en/book.phar.php) you can use the `build` script included.
Make sure that your `php.ini` has the *Off* or 0 value for the `phar.readonly` setting.
Also you need to create an empty `downloads` directory in the project root.

# Contributing

Httpful highly encourages sending in pull requests.  When submitting a pull request please:

 - All pull requests should target the `dev` branch (not `master`)
 - Make sure your code follows the [coding conventions](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php)
